# Junior Developer Workflow: AI Collaboration & Debugging (2026)

This document outlines the standard operating procedure for using AI tools effectively and approaching production-level issues as a fresher.

## 🤖 1. Daily Workflow: AI as a Collaborative Partner
In 2026, AI is not a code-generator; it is a **senior mentor** available 24/7. Avoid asking for "full solutions" to ensure you are actually learning the logic.

### Prompting for Logic, Not Just Syntax
When you need help, focus on the **how** and **why** rather than just the "what."
*   **Weak Prompt:** "Write a prime number function."
*   **Strong Prompt:** "Write a Python function to check if a number is prime, optimized for numbers up to 10,000. Explain the time complexity of your approach."

### "Rubber Ducking" with AI
When you hit a wall, use AI to unblock your thinking without spoiling the answer.
*   **The Strategy:** Paste your incomplete code and say: *"I'm trying to solve this by sorting the input, but I feel stuck. Don't give me the code; give me a high-level hint about a better data structure I could use."*

### Real-time Learning
Leverage IDE-integrated tools like [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com) or [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com) for instant clarification:
*   **Explain Feature:** Highlight unfamiliar syntax or legacy code, right-click, and select **"Explain"** for a plain-English breakdown.
*   **Documentation Search:** Use AI to find specific methods in the latest 2026 documentation instead of scrolling through long manual pages.

## 🐞 2. Debugging Example: The "Broken API" Case
If a user says "I can't log in," don't panic. Think of yourself as a detective. You need to find "clues" before you can solve the mystery. In 2026, we follow these three steps:

### Step 1: Find the "Clue" (The Error Message)
Before asking an AI for help, you must find the specific error message generated by the computer.
*   **Where to look:** Open your web browser (Chrome, Edge, or Brave), **right-click** anywhere on the page, select **Inspect**, and click the **Console** tab.
*   **What to look for:** Look for red text. For example: `ReferenceError: user_data is not defined`.
*   **Why it matters:** This tells you the exact name or variable the computer doesn't recognize. Without this, the AI is just guessing.

### Step 2: Ask AI "Why," Not Just "Fix"
If you only give the AI the error message, it might give you a generic answer that doesn't fit your project. You must provide the **context** (the code around the error).
*   ❌ **The Wrong Way:** "How do I fix user_data is not defined?"
*   ✅ **The 2026 Way:** Paste your login function and say: 
    > *"I am getting an error saying `user_data` is not defined. I thought I created it in my login route. Looking at my code below, did I forget to pass this variable, or is it a scoping issue?"*

### Step 3: Find "Hidden" (Production) Problems
Sometimes code works perfectly on your computer but breaks for real users. This usually happens because users do things you didn't expect (like leaving a field blank).
*   **Brainstorm with AI:** Ask: *"My login code works for me, but some users are still having trouble. What are 3 edge cases (like emojis in passwords or very long emails) that might break this specific logic?"*
*   **Use Modern Tools:** In 2026, we use the [Sentry AI Debugger](https://sentry.io). It provides a "session replay" (a video-like reconstruction) of the crash. You can feed this data into your AI editor like [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com) to see exactly what the user clicked before the error happened.

## ✅ 3. The Fresher Checklist for Production Issues
When a bug hits production, follow this rigorous workflow to ensure a safe fix:

1.  **Isolate:** Feed the AI one function at a time to avoid "context drift" or confusion.
2.  **Verify:** If the AI suggests a fix (e.g., *"You forgot a flush() call"*), research the function on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org) or [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) to understand what it does.
3.  **Test:** Ask the AI: *"Write a Unit Test for the fix you just proposed to ensure it doesn't break existing functionality."*
4.  **Audit:** Double-check that the AI isn't hallucinating non-existent libraries or suggesting outdated 2024/2025 syntax that is deprecated in 2026.
